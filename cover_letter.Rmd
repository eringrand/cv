To whom this may concern,

Hello, my name is Erin Grand, and I am writing for consideration of a job at Headspace Health. I have 6 years of experience working as a Data Scientist, 8 years of writing in R and SQL, and 4 years of practice training in R.

My love of education, statistics, and coding drove me to a career in data science.  After completing my MS degree at Columbia University, I applied my skills at organizations with public good in mind, such as my past work at the Crisis Text Line and Uncommon Schools.

At Crisis Text Line, a text based crisis hotline, I worked on the online training platform helping trainers better assist their trainees in how to be crisis counselors. I transitioned to work at Uncommon Schools, a charter management organization with more than 50 schools, to work more directly with education research. I created several predictive models to help teachers identify students most at risk of not passing state exams and enable school leaders to view students at risk of attrition.

I care deeply about mental health and have been an active Headspace user for several years. I would love to be a part of making this amazing resource even better. 

Thank you kindly for your time and consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon.



Sincerely yours,
