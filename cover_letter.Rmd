To whom this may concern,

Hello, my name is Erin Grand and I am writing in response to your open position for an Astronomical Data Scientist position at Space Telescope Science Institute, as seen on Twitter.  While I was confident from the posting alone that this would be a great next step in my career, discussing the position and expectations with Dr. Arfon Smith and Dr. Ivelina Momcheva cemented it for me. Between my research work and practical experience, I bring a combined 9 years of experience in both data science and astronomy to a role that feels perfectly tailored to all of my interests.

I received both my undergraduate and masters degrees in astronomy from the University of Maryland in 2007 and 2014 respectively.  During my course of study, I worked at NASA to create an [ultraviolet mosaic of Andromeda](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/uv_andromeda.html). This image has been featured on [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101027.html) twice since publication. As part of my thesis research, I spent 3 years working with data from the CARMA radio observatory to study dense gas in star forming regions. I also worked with the Education and Public Outreach sector at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on two projects, the Science on a Sphere data library, and the traveling Hubble Space Telescope museum exhibit. 

My research work drove me to pursue a career in data science, because of my love of statistics and coding.  Since then I have applied my skills at organizations that have true public good in mind, such as my past work at the Crisis Text Line.  While there, I was able to use data to help redefine the application process to bring in the best people to be counselors. At Uncommon Schools, a charter management organization with more than 50 schools, I created several predictive models to help teachers identify students most at risk of not passing state exams.

A driving career goal for me has been to combine my astronomy and data science passions to further science. Iâ€™m excited to apply this energy and determination to grow and learn at Space Telescope Science Institute. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely yours,
